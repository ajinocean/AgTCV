# AgTCV
In this study, we developed a novel strategy for RA treatment, namely AntiGen-specific T Cell Vaccine (AgTCV). Subcutaneous administration of AgTCV significantly alleviated inflammation, cartilage damage, and bone erosion in RA. Through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we uncovered the previously overlooked role of neutrophils in immune tolerance remodeling.
